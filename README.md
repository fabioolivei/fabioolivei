# My Projects:

## **Machine Learning**


* ### [**Diabetes Alert: A Machine Learning-Based App:**](https://shre.ink/rvNt)

<div align="center">

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*3xBqh5Df8qJj98VNi2GS0w.jpeg" />

</div>

- **Project Objectives:** To develop an ML model for predicting diabetes with high precision and recall, targeting early intervention and enhanced patient health management.

- **Deployment**:
For this project, the model was deployed using a Gradio app hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

- **Without a Detection Model:** Consider a scenario where a health clinic serves 10,000 patients per month, of which 1,000 have diabetes, but only 150 are diagnosed in time.

- **With the Optimized XGBoost Model (The Best Model)**: The model identifies 900 patients as potential diabetes cases. Of those 900, 750 actually have diabetes and are diagnosed.

- **Impact Result:** Thanks to the best diabetes prediction model, the clinic can identify and diagnose early 750 diabetes cases among patients. This represents a significant increase in detection compared to the previous scenario, where only 150 cases were diagnosed.





* ### [**Billions in Losses Avoided! Machine Learning in the Fight Against Card Fraud:**](https://shre.ink/UpF5)


<div align="center">

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*mnxrPjQxlHBdty3ZiVW8iw.png" />

</div>

- What is the importance of Machine Learning in practice, in this project?
  
**Without a Detection Model**:

*   Consider a company with R$ 500 billion in transactions, where 7.5 billion are frauds.
*   It manages to detect and prevent 15% of the frauds: (R$ 1.125 billion).
*   Still, R$ 6.375 billion in frauds go unnoticed.

**With the best Machine Learning model found in this project**:

*   The model identifies R$ 7.05 billion as potential frauds.
*   Of this total, R$ 6.2 billion are actually frauds and are avoided. Thanks to our best model, the company manages to avoid an additional loss of R$ 6.2 billion in frauds.

* ### [**YouTube Insights: Uma Análise dos Canais Mais Bem-Sucedidos da Plataforma:**](https://shre.ink/rYcD)

<div align="center">

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*0oAVUuAAK6kiDILND2EReA.png" />

</div>

- **Understanding the Analysis:** The aim of this analysis is to explore the diverse landscape of YouTube channels, identifying the most popular ones, their categories, and the impact of different countries on the platform. This includes understanding success metrics such as the number of subscribers and video views, and how these factors correlate with creators' earnings.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Here, we answer some important questions for our analysis. Initially, we conducted a detailed statistical description of the dataset to get a basic understanding of trends and patterns. A temporal analysis was performed, correlating various variables to extract deeper insights. Then, we focused on the count of channels from different countries, categorizing them to facilitate comparisons and themes.

- **Trends and Correlations:** Understanding the relationship between engagement and profitability in the current YouTube landscape.

- **Power of Data:** The critical importance of data analysis and analytics in optimizing content and marketing strategies.

* ### [**Machine Learning e Health Insurance: Impacto na Previsão de Seguros de Saúde:**](https://shre.ink/rXwd)

<div align="center" >

<img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQFhjYnh9YPVQQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1704463771968?e=1714608000&v=beta&t=DAQzeITTnvwhfglzk0nWg-QYtx0y1cB_jPXXb4BS7WQ" width=700 />

</div>

- **Business Understanding:**
The dataset focuses on predicting health insurance costs based on factors such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and region. Understanding these relationships is crucial for insurers to price policies accurately.

- Insights and Recommendations Pricing Strategy: Consider factors such as number of children, smoking habits, and BMI for pricing, given their impact on health costs. 

- Regional Evaluation: Analyze regional differences to adapt pricing and coverage strategies. 

- Modeling: The model shows good overall performance, with a high R2 and a relatively low MAPE on unseen data, which is encouraging for its practical application.

* ### [**A/B Testing Strategies in Fast Food Advertising:**](https://shre.ink/rhPB)

<div align="center">

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*BiwbOpLPRZIZbBZh6RHyjQ.png" />

</div>

- **Objective:** The aim is to analyze a Fast Food Marketing Campaign dataset to understand the impact of different promotions on sales and identify the most effective strategies.

- **Key Question:** Which marketing promotions are most effective in driving sales?

**Statistical Significance (p-values)**:
- Promotion 1 vs Promotion 2: p-value ≈ 4.29e-10
- Promotion 1 vs Promotion 3: p-value ≈ 0.121
- Promotion 2 vs Promotion 3: p-value ≈ 1.57e-06

Evaluation
- A/B Testing Results: Identified that Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 are statistically more effective than Promotion 2.
- Cross-Validation: Lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE): The lowest value, 0.085, suggests a relatively good performance of the model in that specific fold, indicating that the model had an average squared error of approximately 85 sales (when we multiply by 1000 to convert back to the original scale of 'SalesInThousands').

</div>

- ### Data Acquisition:
All data used here were obtained from the Inside Airbnb website.

- ### Why Travel to Lisbon?
Imagine embarking on a journey that takes you to a place where the roots of Brazil's history are deeply intertwined, be it through its architecture, cuisine, and hospitality. The city boasts renowned museums such as the National Tile Museum and the National Museum of Ancient Art, and a traditional cuisine with dishes like codfish and pastéis de nata.

- ### Conclusion:
Based on the data and analyses conducted, we observe that the majority of properties in Lisbon listed on Airbnb are full houses or apartments available for rent. Moreover, there is also a significant number of private rooms available. We can also define the average of the highest and lowest values for the 10 neighborhoods.


* ### [**COVID-19 in Brazil and the world:**](https://shre.ink/9PXH)

<div align="center">

</div>

- ### Purpose of This Article
The aim of this analysis is to examine the current data on COVID-19, both in Brazil and worldwide, three years after the pandemic began. We will look into insights through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the disease's situation.

- ### Data Collection and Analysis:
Reliable data collection was carried out to understand the impact of COVID-19 and monitor its progression. Using data from various sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN), and official reports from local governments.

- ### Bonus:
I made a bar chart race of 10 selected countries based on the cumulative number of recorded deaths.
