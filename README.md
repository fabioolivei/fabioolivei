# My Projects:

## **Machine Learning**


* ### [**Diabetes Alert: A Machine Learning-Based App:**](https://shre.ink/rvNt)

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*3xBqh5Df8qJj98VNi2GS0w.jpeg" />

- **Project Objectives:** To develop an ML model for predicting diabetes with high precision and recall, targeting early intervention and enhanced patient health management.

- **Deployment**:
For this project, the model was deployed using a Gradio app hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

- **Without a Detection Model:** Consider a scenario where a health clinic serves 10,000 patients per month, of which 1,000 have diabetes, but only 150 are diagnosed in time.

- **With the Optimized XGBoost Model (The Best Model)**: The model identifies 900 patients as potential diabetes cases. Of those 900, 750 actually have diabetes and are diagnosed.

- **Impact Result:** Thanks to the best diabetes prediction model, the clinic can identify and diagnose early 750 diabetes cases among patients. This represents a significant increase in detection compared to the previous scenario, where only 150 cases were diagnosed.


  

* ### [**Billions in Losses Avoided! Machine Learning in the Fight Against Card Fraud:**](https://shre.ink/UpF5)

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*mnxrPjQxlHBdty3ZiVW8iw.png" />

- What is the importance of Machine Learning in practice, in this project?
  
**Without a Detection Model**:

*   Consider a company with R$ 500 billion in transactions, where 7.5 billion are frauds.
*   It manages to detect and prevent 15% of the frauds: (R$ 1.125 billion).
*   Still, R$ 6.375 billion in frauds go unnoticed.

**With the best Machine Learning model found in this project**:

*   The model identifies R$ 7.05 billion as potential frauds.
*   Of this total, R$ 6.2 billion are actually frauds and are avoided. Thanks to our best model, the company manages to avoid an additional loss of R$ 6.2 billion in frauds.

* ### [**YouTube Insights: Uma An√°lise dos Canais Mais Bem-Sucedidos da Plataforma:**](https://shre.ink/rYcD)

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*0oAVUuAAK6kiDILND2EReA.png" />

- **Understanding the Analysis:** The aim of this analysis is to explore the diverse landscape of YouTube channels, identifying the most popular ones, their categories, and the impact of different countries on the platform. This includes understanding success metrics such as the number of subscribers and video views, and how these factors correlate with creators' earnings.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Here, we answer some important questions for our analysis. Initially, we conducted a detailed statistical description of the dataset to get a basic understanding of trends and patterns. A temporal analysis was performed, correlating various variables to extract deeper insights. Then, we focused on the count of channels from different countries, categorizing them to facilitate comparisons and themes.

- **Trends and Correlations:** Understanding the relationship between engagement and profitability in the current YouTube landscape.

- **Power of Data:** The critical importance of data analysis and analytics in optimizing content and marketing strategies.

* ###[**Machine Learning e Health Insurance: Impacto na Previs√£o de Seguros de Sa√∫de:**](https://shre.ink/rXwd)

<img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQFhjYnh9YPVQQ/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0/1704463771968?e=1714608000&v=beta&t=DAQzeITTnvwhfglzk0nWg-QYtx0y1cB_jPXXb4BS7WQ" />

- **Business Understanding:**
The dataset focuses on predicting health insurance costs based on factors such as age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and region. Understanding these relationships is crucial for insurers to price policies accurately.

- Insights and Recommendations Pricing Strategy: Consider factors such as number of children, smoking habits, and BMI for pricing, given their impact on health costs. 

- Regional Evaluation: Analyze regional differences to adapt pricing and coverage strategies. 

- Modeling: The model shows good overall performance, with a high R2 and a relatively low MAPE on unseen data, which is encouraging for its practical application.

* ###[**A/B Testing Strategies in Fast Food Advertising:**](https://shre.ink/rhPB)

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*BiwbOpLPRZIZbBZh6RHyjQ.png" />

- **Objective:** The aim is to analyze a Fast Food Marketing Campaign dataset to understand the impact of different promotions on sales and identify the most effective strategies.

- **Key Question:** Which marketing promotions are most effective in driving sales?

**Statistical Significance (p-values)**:
- Promotion 1 vs Promotion 2: p-value ‚âà 4.29e-10
- Promotion 1 vs Promotion 3: p-value ‚âà 0.121
- Promotion 2 vs Promotion 3: p-value ‚âà 1.57e-06

Evaluation
- A/B Testing Results: Identified that Promotion 1 and Promotion 3 are statistically more effective than Promotion 2.
- Cross-Validation: Lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE): The lowest value, 0.085, suggests a relatively good performance of the model in that specific fold, indicating that the model had an average squared error of approximately 85 sales (when we multiply by 1000 to convert back to the original scale of 'SalesInThousands').
