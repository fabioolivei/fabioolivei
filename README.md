# My Projects:

## **Machine Learning**

* ### [**Diabetes Alert: A Machine Learning-Based App:**](https://shre.ink/rvNt)

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*3xBqh5Df8qJj98VNi2GS0w.jpeg" />

- **Project Objectives:** To develop an ML model for predicting diabetes with high precision and recall, targeting early intervention and enhanced patient health management.

- **Deployment**
For this project, the model was deployed using a Gradio app hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

- **Without a Detection Model:** Consider a scenario where a health clinic serves 10,000 patients per month, of which 1,000 have diabetes, but only 150 are diagnosed in time.

- **With the Optimized XGBoost Model** (The Best Model): The model identifies 900 patients as potential diabetes cases. Of those 900, 750 actually have diabetes and are diagnosed.

- **Impact Result:** Thanks to the best diabetes prediction model, the clinic can identify and diagnose early 750 diabetes cases among patients. This represents a significant increase in detection compared to the previous scenario, where only 150 cases were diagnosed.

  

* ### [**Billions in Losses Avoided! Machine Learning in the Fight Against Card Fraud:**](https://shre.ink/UpF5)

- What is the importance of Machine Learning in practice, in this project?
  
**Without a Detection Model**:

*   Consider a company with R$ 500 billion in transactions, where 7.5 billion are frauds.
*   It manages to detect and prevent 15% of the frauds: (R$ 1.125 billion).
*   Still, R$ 6.375 billion in frauds go unnoticed.

**With the best Machine Learning model found in this project**:

*   The model identifies R$ 7.05 billion as potential frauds.
*   Of this total, R$ 6.2 billion are actually frauds and are avoided. Thanks to our best model, the company manages to avoid an additional loss of R$ 6.2 billion in frauds.
